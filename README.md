# uk-planning-permission-check

The task:
"Welcome to the PlanningHub Code Challenge!

Please provide pseudo or Python code for the given diagram. Your code should determine whether planning permission is required (Y) or not required (N) for a fence, gate, or wall in various scenarios.

If the site falls under the universal category, which should be checked first, planning permission is required. If the site is not in one of the universal categories, other conditions will establish if planning permission is required. Some examples might not require a planning permission and some will require planning permission if multiple conditions are met.

We are keen to understand if you can independently write a scalable code for this type of task. 

We will be scoring your work based on the following criteria:

Diligence: Please ensure you cover all given scenarios including these with multiple variables.
Ability to write code in a structured and readable way: As you will work in a team, it is critical that your code can be easily navigated and modified by other users.
You are welcome to use online tools for writing the code, but please work independently without input from other engineers.
We are looking for scalable, diligent and complete solutions and if you want to impress, please do!
Please let us know which parts of the challenge you found difficult and which parts were easy."
